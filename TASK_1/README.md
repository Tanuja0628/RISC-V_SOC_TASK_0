The SoC design process starts with the chip modeling phase. Here, the hardware functionality is represented at a high level using a C-model. During this stage (O0/O1), software written in C is compiled with GCC. The specifications are then checked against a C-language testbench. This step allows designers to confirm that the high-level model behaves as intended, without focusing on hardware implementation details. After validating the specifications, the process moves to the RTL development phase (O2). In this phase, a soft copy of the hardware is created using RTL (Register Transfer Level) design in Verilog. The RTL outlines the accurate hardware architecture, including the processor core and peripheral IPs. The previous C testbench is reused to validate the RTL design against the high-level specifications. This ensures that the C-model and RTL perform equivalently.

After verifying the RTL, the design advances to the synthesis stage, where the RTL is transformed into a gate-level netlist using synthesis tools. The gate-level netlist shows the design with logic gates that can be physically built in silicon. At the same time, macros (synthesized RTL blocks) and analog IPs (described at the functional RTL level) are added. These components, along with the processor and peripheral IPs, are combined in the SoC integration phase (O3). In this phase, all components are connected, and interfaces such as GPIOs are integrated. Following this integration, the physical design (backend) flow begins. This involves floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis (CTS), and routing to ensure the design meets timing, power, and area constraints.

The final step is the RTL-to-GDSII (RTL2GDS) flow. Here, the verified design is converted into the GDSII file format, which is the standard layout database for chip fabrication. Before sending the GDSII to the foundry, DRC (Design Rule Check) and LVS (Layout vs. Schematic) checks are performed. These checks ensure that the layout follows fabrication rules and matches the intended schematic. Once the design clears these checks, it is ready for fabrication as an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit). Throughout this process, from high-level modeling to physical design, the C-language testbench acts as the common verification tool. It ensures consistency and correctness of the design at each stage.
